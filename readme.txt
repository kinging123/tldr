Put a small snippet next to each post which tells the users how long it would take to read the post, just like in Medium.com.


== Description ==
TL;DR is a common short for "Too long - Didn't read". This plugin allows you to put a small snippet next to each post which tells the users how long it would take to read the post, just like in [Medium.com](http://medium.com).

This plugin is smarter than most reading timers, because it takes into account the images and the videos of the post. In the future there will be even more support for image height, better support for media (videos and mp3s), and more!

This plugin can work on any theme but it works best on themes that support TL;DR.

== Installation ==
After the usual installation, you'll probably need to go to the settings and check one of the "force ..." checkboxes. This is to make sure your visitors cn see the minutes count even if your theme wasn't built to support TL;DR.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
I installed the plugin but I can't see the minutes on the website. Why?
----
A: Go to the settings page and check one of the "force .." checkboxes. You can choose where to show the text - after the title or the date (more to come).
